# Recap
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Sourcode hosting platforms like Github or Bitbucked supports markdown syntax. It makes it extremely usfeul for writing readme files.
